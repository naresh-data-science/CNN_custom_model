	<h1>CNN Custom Model on COVID, Normal, Pneumonia</h1>
	<p>This is a custom model built using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting COVID, normal, and pneumonia from X-Ray images. The model is trained on a dataset of X-Ray images from patients with COVID, normal, and pneumonia, and can accurately predict the presence of these conditions with high accuracy.</p>
	<h2>Dataset</h2>
	<p>The dataset used for training the model consists of X-Ray images from patients with COVID, normal, and pneumonia. The images have been pre-processed to ensure they are of the same size and format, and have been labelled with their respective conditions. The dataset used for training the model consists of approximately 6300  images each for COVID, normal, and pneumonia.</p>
	<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
	<p>The model consists of several layers including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Convolutional Layer</li>
		<li>Max Pooling Layer</li>
		<li>Flatten Layer</li>
		<li>Dense Layer</li>
		<li>Output Layer</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Convolutional Layer extracts features from the X-Ray images, and the Max Pooling Layer reduces the dimensionality of the data. The Flatten Layer prepares the data for the Dense Layer, which is used for making predictions. Finally, the Output Layer predicts the presence of COVID, normal, and pneumonia with high accuracy.</p>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>The model can be used for making predictions on X-Ray images of patients with COVID, normal, and pneumonia. The user can input an X-Ray image, and the model will return a prediction of the condition present in the image.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>This CNN Custom Model on COVID, Normal, Pneumonia is a highly accurate model for detecting COVID, normal, and pneumonia from X-Ray images. It can be used in hospitals and clinics to quickly diagnose patients and take necessary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
